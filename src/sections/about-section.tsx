8 years of experience.

I have end-to-end ownership experience across applications lifecycle, including system architecture, feature development, performance optimization, maintenance, technical leadership, and CI/CD-based deployments to the App Store and Google Play. I have built products from scratch, mentored engineers, and contributed to applications used by over 1,000,000 users.

I delivered a 40% reduction in CPU usage on a mission-critical logistics application used for package scanning and delivery, significantly improving performance and operational efficiency at scale.

I am a proactive, collaborative engineer with strong communication skills and a growth mindset. I thrive in cross-functional, international teams and consistently focus on delivering high-quality, user-centric solutions with measurable business impact.                </p>
